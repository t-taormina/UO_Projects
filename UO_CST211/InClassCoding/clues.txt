It was the best of times, it was
the worst of times, and at 2342 Delphi Lane there
was trouble of the worst kind. Canine
invaders from the dog star,
including alphie@sirius.milkyway.stars and
sophie@canis_major.milkyway.stars, for example,  were
lurking about, grinning and barking.
The leader appears to
be Fido_321@canis_major.milkyway.stars.
Fido led the other dog invaders
to 14 W Feline Ave, Fresno CA for a
strategy session, but there encountered
stiff resistance from the cat army.
Over at 123 W 123d Street, everything
was calm.
