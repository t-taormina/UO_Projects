"""
In 212 we will be programming in C. (very close to bare metal programming). 
Do basic tutorials in C in order to get familiar. Get used to using areas
of memory. The things that people struggle with is the idea of pointers.
Pointers are similar to references but need to be managed more manually. 
Get used to using arrays and pointers in C. You will use pointers to functions.
